# Mental health app - flutter clean architecture - NodeJs - Postgresql - Gemini

Let's build a comprehensive mental health app! We'll dive deep into Flutter's capabilities to create a beautiful and intuitive user interface, structured with clean architecture for maintainability. On the backend, Node.js will power our API, handling data management, and AI integration. PostgreSQL will serve as our robust database for storing user information, tasks, moods, and playlists. To enhance the app's functionality, we'll leverage Gemini's AI capabilities for personalized advice generation. Firebase will be our go-to for storing user-uploaded songs. Together, these technologies will form the backbone of our app, enabling us to build a powerful tool for improving mental well-being.
